# Weather App

Made by Mudit Khandelwal.

The app lists all the countries in a table and when selected, displays the weather, temprature and wind conditions of the capital of the country.

## Running Locally

Set up angular for development by following the guide on `https://angular.io/guide/setup-local`.

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Run `ng serve --open` afterwards to start a local server. If the app does not open automatically, go to your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`.
